# SentenceMiningFormAndScripts

For language learning, sentence mining by screenshotting a video clip, recording the audio and pasting those into Anki is not a new idea.
However, all the hotkeys, coordination and things to remember makes this process much more complicated than it needs to be.
To solve this problem, I created a Windows Form application in C# and wrote multiple scripts in AutoHotkey that allow you to take a screenshot,
record audio, and paste them into an Anki card with just 3 hotkey presses.
